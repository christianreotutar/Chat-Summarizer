    Nivre and Noah Smith, for ACL-05 by Hwee Tou Ng and Kemal Oflazer,
    for ACL-02 by Eugene Charniak and Dekang Lin, and earlier ACL and
    EACL formats.  Those versions were written by several people,
    including John Chen, Henry S. Thompson and Donald Walker.

\begin{abstract}
  Document classification is an important machine learning and natural language processing topic that has applications in spam filters and summarization techniques. In this typically multi-class problem, the Na{\"i}ve Bayes classifier is a popular model with results rivaling that of the Support Vector Machine classifier with shorter training time. In this survey, we seek to find improvements in the Na{\"i}ve Bayes classifier such that accuracy is improved and compare this to another classifier used in the problem space.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Here we give a brief overview and definition the document classification background 

\subsection{Problems in document classification}
Here we talk about problems in this problem space and how it's applied.

\subsection{Summarization}
Here we talk about our specific domain, summarization, and how document classification relates to this.


\section{Data Description}
Here we talk about Twitter data and how it relates to our problem

\section{Machine Learning Techniques}
Here give a broad overview of what we're comparing, what techniques we used and why

\subsection{Na{\"i}ve Bayes}
Here we give background into the classifier

\subsection{Modified Na{\"i}ve Bayes}
Here we give background into the classifier + word2vec library

\subsection{Other Classifier}
Here we give background into the classifier

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Data Description}
Here we talk about the filtering done on the data, the importance of feature vector formation and attribute picking, and the problems we came upon (e.g. language, more than one hash tag).

\subsection{Code for Na{\"i}ve Bayes}

\subsection{Code for Modified Na{\"i}ve Bayes}

\subsection{Code for Other Classifier}

\section{Results}
Here we give a broad overview of our results

\subsection{Comparisons}
Lots of tables and graphs

\subsection{Explanations}
It is important that we relate our results  to the classifiers we used and other ML topics.

\subsection{How we can improve}
Any improvements for the classifiers we did not have time to implement
